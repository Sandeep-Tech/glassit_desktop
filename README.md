[glassit](https://github.com/hikarin522/GlassIt-VSC), but for desktop (Ubuntu).

NOTE: The term "glassit" is 'borrowed' from  [hikarin522](https://github.com/hikarin522) 's project [glassit VSCode extension](https://github.com/hikarin522/GlassIt-VSC) of the same name, I don't own that name and will gladly change it to something else if asked by hikarin522 but I am moving on with this name for the time being as this project will probably only be used by me and my brother. Thanks to hikarin522, [devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/@devaslife) and my mind for the inspiration.
